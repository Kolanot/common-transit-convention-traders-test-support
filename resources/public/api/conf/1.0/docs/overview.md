This API allows testers to inject departure and arrival movement notifications as if they have come from the office of departure and the office of destination by the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS).

To review our progress and to see what you can test, take at look at our [Roadmap](/roadmaps/common-transit-convention-traders-roadmap).


For more information about how to develop your own client applications, including example clients for this API, 
see [Tutorials](/api-documentation/docs/tutorials).

## How to get set up for testing

Follow these steps to get set up for testing.

1. Register for a [developer account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration).

2. Create an application.    

3. Subscribe to any API you might be working on. We suggest [Create Test User API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0) along with [Common Transit Convention Traders API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/1.0) and Common Transit Convention Traders Test Support API (which is on this page).     

4. Create a [Client ID and Client Secret](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/credentials).

5. Use the [Create Test User API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0) to get a user ID, password, EORI enrolment and other test details. 


## How to use the CTC Trader Test Support API

You can can use this API for any test scenario you choose. It is not connected to the NCTS core. Itâ€™s up to you to trigger the response messages in the order you require.  Valid response message types are listed below.

1.  Send message from a trader to the NCTS using the the [CTC Traders API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/common-transit-convention-traders/1.0). This could be IE014, IE015, IE007 or IE044. See [message we support](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/common-transit-convention-traders-service-guide/documentation/supported-messages.html) for more details. 

2. Inject an NCTS response using the Common Transit Traders Test Support API.

3. GET messages for this movement from the CTC Traders API. This will include both the trader and the NCTS messages.

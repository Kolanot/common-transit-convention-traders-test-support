This API allows testers to inject departure and arrival movement notifications as if they came from the Office of Departure and Office of Destination via the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS).

To review our progress and to see what you can test, take a look at our [Roadmap](/roadmaps/common-transit-convention-traders-roadmap).

Further details of the User Application Restricted Authentication are given on the 
[Authorisation](/api-documentation/docs/authorisation) page.

For more information about how to develop your own client applications, including example clients for this API, 
see [Tutorials](/api-documentation/docs/tutorials).
